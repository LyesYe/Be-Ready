# How
It’s a levels type of game, where the player will face all sorts of tasks to do in order to learn and thus survive when the danger occurs. 

It’s based on 3 levels: Before, During and After the catastrophe. Each level contains some tasks to accomplish that would make you win points or some sort of reward at the end of the game. 
You can consider it as a fun training for the kids. 

We learn while having fun. 

The main language of this project is going to be Arabic, we’ll try to add it everywhere: Tasks, Menus...etc
